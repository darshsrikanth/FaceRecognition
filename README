A python program that detects a face within a list of pictures and matches them, showing their name and percentage match.

First, put whatever pictures of people that you want scanned in the ImagesAttendance folder.
These pictures are then scanned to find their exact measurements on the face, which will be used to calculate if other faces are the same or not.

Then, run the program and your webcam will be turned on. You will then show faces that you want scanned to the webcam.
If the face being scanned is within the ImagesAttendance folder, then the face should correctly be detected as the filename being used as the name.

It will also show you a percentage of how similar the face is to the one scanned in the ImagesAttendance folder.
How this works is the difference of measurements on the face file are compared to the calculated face measurements of the face being shown towards the webcam. 
The comparisons usually yield a value, 0.3 being pretty much a complete match, and any higher number (up to around 1) being less and less similar to the face from your file. 

Finally, the names are then appended to a .csv file, called Attendance.csv. This file will include the name of the individual correctly scanned, and the time they were scanned.
It is in the format H:MM:SS.

Alternatively, there is an excel file named logbook.xlsx that will open and add a new entry every time a new person is scanned (no previously added people are added again).
Every time a new entry will be added, the program closes any application that you wish to have opened the excel file (I do not have excel installed, so the applications name 
is "UltimateFileViewer.exe" in the code), and the program will open again every time the table is updated.

That pretty much sums up everything, so have fun scanning your faces!
